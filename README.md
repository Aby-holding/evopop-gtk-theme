EvoPop
====

A simple, flat and bold Gtk theme for Solus OS & Budgie Desktop.
Iris Dark was used as base.

This project is still a work in progress.
Requires Gtk 3.16 to function properly.

###Notice:
Since i had unfixable issues with the window controls support for 3.14 & unity is dropped.
However a version of the theme with normal window controls named [BasePop](https://github.com/poltertec/basepop-gtk-theme) can be used.

###Installation Instructions:

Extract the zip file & run the included install script.

    sh autogen.sh
    sudo make install

Use Budgie settings to change the theme to EvoPop.
